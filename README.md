## Introduction
This project lets users keep track of the hours they spend practising their musical instruments. This is my first project that has a backend component, and I developed it using Django and deployed it on Heroku.

## Features
- Users are able to record their practice sessions, and keep track of the instruments and songs they practised.
- Filtering options for users to filter through the increasingly long list of sessions/instruments/pieces.
- Summary statistics for all the sessions, instruments, and pieces, as well as for each individual instrument and piece.
- Clean and responsive UI.

## Future Plans
- Use libraries (like Crispy Forms) to improve how the various forms are rendered.
- Create a "forgot password" button in the login page

## Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without:
1. Ruth Lim — Helped with the UI design
2. Ethan Chan – (Unintentionally) gave me project idea
